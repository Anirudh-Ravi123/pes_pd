**How to talk to Computers**
**Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs**

Lets us discuss this with an Aurdino board as an example.
An Arduino board is a popular open-source electronics platform that consists of a microcontroller, development environment. It is a small computer chip that processes instructions and controls the behavior of your electronic project.Arduino boards work by providing a platform for you to write and upload code that controls the behavior of the microcontroller on the board.

This board can describe it in a form of a block diagram:

- This is the typical board diagram with the processor and all the interfaces

the IC it looks something like this

- This IC contains the QFN-48(Quad Flat No-Leads) 7nmx7nm package
-  contains 48 electrical connections or pins
-  pin locations of the ackage are given by the arduino board.

The main chip is located at the centre of the package and is connected to the pins by wire bounds.
These wire bounds trasnfer all the incoming signals to the chip

The chip in the package when opened up looks like this:

-  PADs in chip are like the  metal  points on the bottom of the chipthat are  used to connect the chip to a circuit through signal can be sent into the chip.
-  Core of a chip is  the central part that  processes the information.Its a place where all our Digital logical sitslike the AND gate,OR gate,MUXs,etc.
-  Die s a tiny, flat piece of silicon that contains the actual electronic circuits and defines the size of the chip. The  Die is manufactured on a Silicon wafer.

The core of the CHIP contains  an SoC SRAM,ADCs,DACs,PLL,SPI and some momre components.

- the SRAM,ADC,DAC,PLL  are known As Foundry IP's.
-  a foundry refers to a specialized facility or company that manufactures integrated circuits (ICs) or microchips.
-  the SoC and the SPI are basically called as Macros.

  
  **Introduction to RISC-V**

  RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) for designing and implementing custom microprocessors and other hardware.
- HIGH LEVEL CODING LANGUAGE Like C or C++
- Complied to RISCV assembly language program converted to binary level logic 1 and logic 0
- HARDWARE DESCRIPTION LANGAUGE implements the RISCV assembply program using an RTL(register transfer logic)
- RTL converted to layout (GDS - Graphic Data System)

**From Software Applications to Hardware**
- Apps: Application software is a type of computer software that is designed to perform specific tasks or functions for end-users.

- System software: System software refers to a category of computer software that acts as an intermediary between the hardware components of a computer system and the user-facing application software. It provides essential services, manages hardware resources, and enables the execution of application programs.

- Operating System: The operating system is a fundamental piece of software that manages hardware resources and provides various services for both users and application programs. It controls tasks such as memory management, process scheduling, file system management, and user interface interaction.

- Compiler: A compiler is a type of software tool that translates high-level programming code written by developers into assembly-level language.

- Assembler: An assembler is a software tool that translates assembly language code into machine code or binary code that can be directly executed by a computer's processor.

- RTL: RTL serves as an abstraction level in the design process that represents the behavior of a digital circuit in terms of registers and the operations that transfer data between them.

- Hardware: Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system or any electronic device. It encompasses all the tangible parts that make up a computing or electronic device and enable it to perform various tasks.
